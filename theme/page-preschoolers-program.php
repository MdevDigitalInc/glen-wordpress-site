        <h1>Preschoolers</h1>
        <p>Welcome Preschoolers! Your child will enjoy even more exciting experiences when they move up to one of our Preschool groups. It is here that children sing, dance, create, run, jump, explore, discover, and engage in imaginative and cooperative play.</p>
        <p>Our Educators co-plan an environment with their children that invites opportunities for strengthening friendships and discovering more of the world around them.  They will be challenged to their fullest learning potential and to develop skills that set a solid foundation for their future successes.</p>
        <p>Our exceptional outdoor program includes a play yard with a sand area shaded by a large maple tree. In the summer, we have a special outdoor program to take advantage of the beautiful weather with lots of fun games, activities and exploration. We pull out our pools for splashing, dig for treasures in our sand area that is shaded by a large sugar maple. Our unique and challenging climber and the large paved bike path also offers many hours of fun large-motor play.</p>

        <p>Arbour Glen has strong ties in the community and one of the things we participate in is an intergenerational program with Kensington Village Retirement Home. It’s been our tradition since the early 1990’s to visit with the senior residents on a regular basis. Sometimes its hard to tell who’s having more fun, them or us!</p>
        <p>As in all rooms, our Preschool Educators spend time observing and recording your child’s learning through play. We use ‘Seesaw’, a digital online portfolio app, to share with you a glimpse into their time spent with us! You will receive occasional snapshots of something special they are doing and an online portfolio of your child’s time at Arbour Glen will be compiled. Participation in ‘Seesaw’ is optional, so we will create paper portfolios for those who choose not to partake. Learning stories and photos are posted throughout the hallways and classrooms. Don’t forget to check them out along with our ‘End-of-day’ posters to keep you ‘in the loop’!</p>
        <p>When it’s time for your child to leave for ‘big school’, they will take lasting friendships and wonderful memories of their time at Arbour Glen. But remember to come back and visit! Warm hugs will always be waiting for them.</p>
