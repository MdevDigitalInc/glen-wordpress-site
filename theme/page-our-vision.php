          <h2>Our Governance</h2>
          <p>We are a not-for-profit, charitable organization, overseen by an Executive Director and governed by a Board of Directors. We are inspected annually by the Ministry of Education. Our Board of Directors consists of parent members as well as community members, who are highly engaged and volunteer their time because of their passion for Arbour Glen, the high quality of care provided, and their belief that our success is based on mutual trust and respect for our families. Board members bring a variety of backgrounds, including education, finance, accounting, marketing, and more. A list of our current Board members is always posted in the Centre, and if ever there are any comments or concerns, parents are welcome to be in touch.</p>
